// in JS  strings can be represnt in both either single quote('') , or double quote("")

const name = "aditya"
const age = 21
console.log( name + age +  "male") //o/p is aditya21male

//this is outdated syntax , in modern days it is replaced by backticks(` `) representation

console.log(`hi my name is ${name} and my age is ${age}`)
